                                    September. This offers sunny days and an average temperature of 31°C.
                                    Most consider the mid-year period to be the best time to go to Bali. You can expect
                                    a good balance between sun, sand and surf during the time. The wet season is October
                                    to April, with occasional downpours and overcast skies. The windy months are between
                                    June and August, which Bali locals often refer to as the kite season, when the skies
                                    are dotted with colourful traditional Balinese kites.</p>
